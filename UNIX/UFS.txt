UNIX File System

  The file system is a method of organising large amounts of daya. Here, file is the smallest unit in which info is stored. 
  Files are further organised into directories. These directories form a tree like structure called file system. 
  The parent directory of file system is called root & is representd by '/'.
 
1. / -> root of the file system
2. /boot -> had files necessary for booting
3. /bin -> contains binary files
4. /dev -> contains files of peripheral devices
5. /home -> home directories of users
6. /root -> directory for superuser root
7. /tmp -> contains temporary files
8. /proc -> virtual file system for meta data of process
9. /lib -> contains system libraries

Classification of UNIX file system

1. Ordinary Files - General files that contain large data
2. Special files - I/O files
3. Directories - Contain both ordinary & special files
4. Pipes - To hold data until used by other processes
5. Socket - Similar to pipes but 2-way communication possible
6. Symbolic links - Used to create pointers to existing file. A file can be accessed either by pointer or name. If a file doesn't exist -> Dangling pointer
