Compile prg1.java first as- <br/>
<br/>`javac -d . Prg1.java` <br/><br/>
Now, after creation of a folder called Pack1, delete the `Prg1.java` file.<br/>
<br/> Finally, execute the `Prg2.java` file just like any regular file.

<br/><br/><br/>
For execution of package under a package, declare `package p2;` inside the `Prg2.java` file and run it similar to `Prg1.java`. <br/>
Now, you need not delete the file that you created previously.
